# pokedex

The goal of this project is to understand the PokéAPI webservice.

I created a website capable of displaying the list of all pokemons returned by the webservice.
When the page loads, the first 15 pokemon are displayed.

Then, with each click on the “next” button, I display the next 15 pokemons, following the previous ones.
